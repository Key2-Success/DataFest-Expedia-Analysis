# DataFest Expedia Analysis
This fun group project was done at UCLA's 48-hour DataFest competition in May of 2017. We were given Expedia data to analyze. We chose to look into how to expand market growth in Germany by finding key insights of German users.

## Content
I have included our presentation outline, a general outline, our slides (which were limited to 2), and my part of the group project's R code (which is quite messy).

## Lessons Learned
1. We spent a day and a half figuring out which question to answer. This was the most frustrating part, because we didn't know where to start. Next time, instead of looking at all the data and feeling overwhelmed, just delve into a small section of the data early on and commit to it.
2. The team's strengths and weaknesses truly complemented each other. Where one failed, another was able to pick up. I truly learned the necessity of diversity on a team, in experiences, skills, and insights. Our 5 person team consisted of 3 majors, which was a huge asset.
3. Have fun! Our team got along very, very well. Many other teams quit early on because they were so frustrated with each other. But for us, we focused on having fun together, which was what made us successful in still enjoying each other even after spending 48 hours together.
4. Use GitHub to share code...lol! Our team didn't have GitHub accounts, so we sent code snippets and files back and forth on Google drive which was quite inefficient. 
5. Learn from other teams! It's very exciting to see how other teams wrangle with the data and which questions they come up with to answer. I found that students from different schools had very different types of analysis, which went to show that the school you attend has an impact on how you analyze, because you are only limited by what you are taught.
